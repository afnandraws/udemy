RULES OF HOOKS

1. You must only call React Hooks in React Functions (React Component Functions and Custom Hooks)
2. Must only call React Hooks at the Top Level(not in nested functions, not in block functions)
3. Make sure to list the dependencies in useEffect(), you dont need to put functions in the dependencies array

ForwardRefs are used to affect information in a child component based on the read information
In lecture 129 he used it to see if an input field was invalid or incorrect and then that input field would be focused.
ForwardRef was needed because the Input.js needed to be accessed
